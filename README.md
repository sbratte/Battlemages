28/02/2021 - Re-Upload

I noticed on the 28/02/2021 that the initial upload did not include any of the supporting folders (Assets, ProjectSettings, etc).
Further investigation indicated this was due to files in the Library directory being over GitHubs 100mb file limit. I attempted to merge
in the remaining directories but it has overwritten the branch and I had to resort to re-adding the whole project.

Unfortunately I have little experience with GitHub and anticipated something may go wrong with merging, so I took screenshots of the source files during the process.
The source files have not been edited past the submission date as indicated by their modification date (aside for the .git folder that was used for pushing to the main branch). Running the scenes will provide the
same game as detailed in the demonstration video.

Apologies for any confusion caused by this error.
